# AWS Whoami Project

The purpose of this project:

* familiar how to deploy to AWS
* how to use AWS gateway to access to the backend service
* how to use ECR to store docker image
* how to use ECS to deploy docker service
* how to use ELB to load balance the backend services
* how to use Route 53 (i.e. DNS) for service discovery
* how to make use of Let's Encrypt for SSL certificate; or use AWS Certificate Manager free public cert?

## whoami

* Small golang server to get the server's information

## Deploy to AWS

* build whoami docker and push to AWS ECR
* go to AWS Elastic Container Service
    + create ECS cluster
        - default VPC
        - check "Amazon EC2 instances"; select "Create new ASG", "Amazon Linux 2", "t2.micro", Minimum 1, Maximum 2, check Monitoring > Use Container Insigns
    + create task definition
        - health check: "CMD-SHELL, curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1"
        - network mode: awsvpc
        - load balance type: Application Load Balancer
    + run new task
        - check "Capacity provider strategy"
        - check "Capacity provider strategy > Use custom (Advanced)", select "Capacity provider" "Infra-ECS-Cluster..."
        - check "Application type > Service"
* go to EC2 > Load balancers
    + copy the DNS name
    + paste it to file ".env" environment variable "URL"
    + invoke "set -a; source .env; set +a"
    + invoke "./script/whoami.sh | jq ."
    ```shell
    kamching@kamching-envy17t:~/workspace/go/src/github.com/chingkamhing/aws-whoami$ ./script/whoami.sh | jq .
    {
      "Hostname": "ip-172-31-16-184.ap-southeast-1.compute.internal",
      "IPs": [
        "127.0.0.1",
        "169.254.172.2",
        "172.31.16.184"
      ],
      "Headers": {
        "Accept": "*/*",
        "User-Agent": "curl/7.85.0",
        "X-Amzn-Trace-Id": "Root=1-640a1258-140fa122090a94e0012a9008",
        "X-Forwarded-For": "1.64.103.176",
        "X-Forwarded-Port": "8000",
        "X-Forwarded-Proto": "http"
      }
    }

    ```
* note
    + somehow, fail to deploy whoami with custom vpc
        - create vpc; in "Resources to create", check "VPC and more"; set "Name tag" to "whoami"; default for others
        - enable public subnets: go to VPC > Subnets > all public subnets, click Actions > Edit subnet settings; check "Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address"
        - create ECS cluster
        - create task definition
        - run task
        - success to deploy; the whoami logs show the app is running successfully and properly response all the health check
        - however, the task will be provision again and again
